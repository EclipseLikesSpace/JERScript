# JERscript
A [scripting language](https://www.google.com/search?q=scripting+language) inspired by [Lua](https://github.com/lua/lua)'s simplicity and [Python](https://www.python.org/) syntax completely made in [Javascript](https://nodejs.org/en/), with [Moo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moo) and [Nearley](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nearley)!

# FAQ
### What does JER stand for?
It stands for: Julian, Eclipse, Rehan (or RStar, depending on what they think)

### Why Javascript?
We chose Javascript because of the 3 main reasons:
- We aren't good with C, C++, Java, or any compiled language for that matter (Except for eclipse with C#)
- We are all good with Javascript and Node.js, we knew the language pretty well or had a master's degree on it
- Even if we did choose a compiled language (example: C++), we'd still suck at it because we can't compile to multiple platforms (We can, it's just that we don't know how)

### Why Python/Lua?
At first, Eclipse loved the idea of Lua's simplicity and C++. Julian didn't really like how we were making a scripting language based of off Lua. We argued for a bit and eventually landed with Lua's simplicity and Python's syntax

### Can the generator generate code aside from Node Javascript?
We're working on it, here is the current table for supported languages:
| Language  | Supported | Notes |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Javascript|Partial Support| Currently being worked on |
|Python|Support Planned||
|Ruby|Support Planned||
|Lua|Support Planned||
|Bash|No Support|May change in the future|
|C|No Support||
|C++|No Support||
